      horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA)
In OpenShift, a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) is a Kubernetes controller that automatically scales the number of replicas (pods) of a deployment or replica set 
based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or other metrics. It ensures that there are enough pods to handle the incoming traffic and scale them up or down as needed.

     Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
A Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) is a Kubernetes controller that adjusts the resource limits and requests of containers based on their actual usage. 
It can increase or decrease the CPU and memory resources allocated to each container to improve their performance and efficiency.

 Deploy the Horizontal pod autoscaler 
 
      -- deploy the application using minimum replicas 
      -- create HPA with minimum and maximum replicas then attach the HPA to deployment (mention deployment app name in HPA )
      
      conclusion
          -- if you put 3 minimum replicas and 7 desired (maximum) replicas in HPA. and you have only 2 replicas in deployment then it will create automatically 1 more 
          replica because of we have given 3 minimum replicas in HPA.
          
          how many replicas you have given in HPA minimum replicas that much replicas it will create automatically , if application is going to access peak stage 
          it will automatically created how many replicas it needed within the maximum replicas.
